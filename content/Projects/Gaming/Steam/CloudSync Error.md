If you are getting this error message, (got it from internet), then there are a few things to try.

First try suggestions like:
1. Double check your steam game's cloud sync feature is on

I got it to work by:
1. Moving the game folder to another drive.
2. Let Steam scan the new drive's game folder
3. Let Steam Cloud Sync again

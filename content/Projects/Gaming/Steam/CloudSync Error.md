If you are getting this error message, (got screenshot from internet), then there are a few things to try.

First try suggestions like:
1. Double check your steam game's cloud sync feature is on

2. Restart Steam/PC
3. Verify game integrity

I got it to work by:
1. Move the installation file from one drive to another. 
2. Uninstall the game from Steam UI (it will remove only the icon in Steam and not touch local file since Steam will look at old installation location) 
3. Try Download the game to the new location you just move the game to. 
4. It will say Cloud Conflict, click to resolve. Select your local save (which should be the newer save compare to Cloud Save)

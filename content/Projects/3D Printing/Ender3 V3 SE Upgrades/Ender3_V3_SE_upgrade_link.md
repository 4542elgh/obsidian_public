Q: Doesnt the ABL function sort of counter the need to do this by creating a mesh and countering any minor discrepancies in the bed level? 

A: Keep in mind your printed part will be skewed based on this. You can mitigate that by starting off with as leveled of a bed as possible.

- 40mm fan can be mounted using some screw or use the anti-vibration silicon insert
- PETG should work, PLA probably will melt

title: Unprivileged LXC and Bind-Mount host directory
---
https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Unprivileged_LXC_containers
# Access Host Dir
Unprivileged LXCs use user/group remapping. So user/group UID/GID 0-65535 inside the LXC will be UID/GID 100000-165535 on the host. 
## Option 1
If you want to access the bind-mount from inside the LXC with UID 109 and GID 117 that bind-mounted folder would need to be owned by UID 100109 and GID 100117 on the host. Something like `chown -R 100117:100117 /mnt/share` on PVE host. This means the folder on PVE host is only viewable/editable for user `100109`, group `100117`, and root of PVE host. Option 2 show you a method to map PVE host's user/group to LXC container, make LXC "borrow" a user account for view/edit.
# Option 2 - LXC idmap (its difficult but you should learn it, its the proper way)
This method have extra steps like editing:
- `/etc/pve/lxc/100.conf`'s `lxc.idmap`
- editing `etc/suibuid` and `/etc/subguid`
## Summary
We want a user on PVE host to exist on LXC container, so LXC can view/edit folder on PVE host. 
- This means we need to create or use an existing user (that is not service account) on PVE and map such user and group to LXC via `lxc.idmap` directive. 
- Updating PVE host's `subuid` and `subgid`
- In LXC, it will need an exact user and group matching PVE host user and group.
## PVE
Everything discuss in this section is done on PVE host machine
### Use existing or create new user + group
- I created a new user call `jellyfin` on PVE host and use an existing group called `smbshare` on PVE host
- **Note down the uid and gid**:
    - UID: `id -u user_name`
    - GID: `getent group group_name` 
    - For this example my uid = `1010`, gid = `1001`
#### Note
Only user and group created by user are in the 1000s range. `apt install` will create service user in 100s range which are **not valid to pass through to LXC**.
- This is crucial knowledge we might need at a later step.
#### Note 2
Its not necessary for your to use matching UID and GID. My UID 1005 and GID 1001, **the uid/gid dont have to match**
### /etc/pve/lxc/10x.conf
You will need to append 6 lines of `lxc.idmap` to your LXC `ID.conf` file. If your LXC container is 100, then you will need to modify `/etc/pve/lxc/100.conf`
```conf
...
lxc.idmap = u 0 100000 1010 # 100000 is default, never change this, PVE's LXC starts at UID 100000; replace 1010 with your UID
lxc.idmap = g 0 100000 1001 # replace 1001 with your GID

lxc.idmap = u 1010 1010 1 # We mapping only 1 UID here
lxc.idmap = g 1001 1001 1 # We mapping only 1 GID here

lxc.idmap = u 1011 101011 64525 # We populate whatever is AFTER the UID you want to add to LXC, so normally it should be like this formula:
# lxc.idmap = u UID+1 100000+UID+1 65535-UID
lxc.idmap = g 1002 101002 64534 # Do the same for GID
```
**Needless to say, you should definitely not pass down root GID and UID since that is equal to a privileged LXC container. I dont think you can pass it in the first place.**
#### Python script
If you feel lazy, just use this tiny python script and just enter your PVE's UID and GID
```python
# Get user UID and GID
uid = int(input("User UID on Proxmox Host: "))
gid = int(input("User GID on Proxmox Host: "))

# Generate LXC configuration lxc.idmap
print(f"lxc.idmap: u 0 100000 {uid}\n" \
    f"lxc.idmap: g 0 100000 {gid}\n" \
    f"lxc.idmap: u {uid} {uid} 1\n" \
    f"lxc.idmap: g {gid} {gid} 1\n" \
    f"lxc.idmap: u {uid+1} {100000+uid+1} {65535-uid}\n" \
    f"lxc.idmap: g {gid+1} {100000+gid+1} {65535-gid}\n")
```
### Modify PVE `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`
> Since LXC creates the CT using root, we have to allow root to use these uids in the container.

PVE Host: `/etc/subuid`
```conf
root:UID:1
# For me it will be
root:1010:1 #UID is 1010, taking 1 slot
```

PVE Host: `/etc/subgid`
```conf
root:GID:1
# For me it will be
root:1001:1 #GID is 1001, taking 1 slot
```
### chown -R
Lastly, the mounting point directory ownership needs to match with LXC idmap's UID and GID.

This will work:
`chown -R jellyfin:smbshare /mnt/Video`
This will also work
`chown -R 1010:1001 /mnt/Video`

This will NOT work: (user is not matching with LXC UID) and you will get permission denied in LXC container
`chown -R root:smbshare /mnt/Video`
## LXC
At this point you can start up your LXC container and check console for error message if any.
- SSH into container and see if your mounting point is accessible. 
All instructions below are done on LXC container, **NOT PVE HOST**
### Troubleshooting
- If the permission is `nobody:nobody`, you did something wrong on the PVE `idmap` or `subuid`/`subgid` side
-  If you see this message, you are attempting to mount 100s service account. Which is not allowed

![[#Note]]
- If you see fail to map, check your `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` to see if you have correct UID and GID

### LXC match PVE user
I ran into an issue where LXC's root account can view/edit the mounted directory but my LXC Jellyfin service (running with LXC account `jellyfin`) cannot see the library I mounted `/Video`. This is due to UID and GID mismatch. 
- LXC `jellyfin` UID is `103` and group is `120`. Meanwhile our PVE's UID is `1010` and GID is `1001`. We will need to migrate LXC's `jellyfin` account `uid` and `gid` to match with PVE.
#### Note 3
It is never a requirement for user to have their own matching name's group. Creating user `jellyfin` does not mean you need to create a group call `jellyfin.` User `jellyfin` can just be a member of `smbshare`.
#### Create group with proper GID first
Since I have `smbshare` group in PVE and that group is not defined in LXC, I will create this group `groupadd -g 1001 smbshare`. Note the GID `1001` should match with PVE
#### Create/update UID and updating folder permission
##### Creating UID
You can create a new user with `useradd jellyfin -u 1010 -g 1001` where `1010` is UID and `1001` is GID. No home directory is required
##### Updating existing UID
I already have a `jellyfin` user with UID 103 (it is created when setting up Jellyfin with script), I need to migrate it to UID `1010` with by editing `/etc/passwd` andÂ `/etc/group`
###### /etc/passwd
Look for `jellyfin` and put `1010:1001` UID (`jellyfin`) : GID(`smbshare`)
- This defines user `jellyfin`'s UID is `1010`, and primary group is `smbshare 1001`
- Again, ![[#Note 3]]
###### /etc/group
Look for `smbshare` and put it like `smbshare:x:1001:jellyfin`
- This defines `smbshare` group have user `jellyfin` in the group
#### Updating old file/folder permission
You need to update all old `jellyfin` owned file/folder with old UID `103` to the new UID `1010` with `find / -uid 103 -exec chown -h 1010 {} +` It will return multiple permission denied for `/lxc` directory, and that is ok.
### Checking mounting point again
Now when you do `ls -la`, you should see LXC folder ownership should match with PVE host ownership.

### Updating systemctl service
Jellyfin use user `jellyfin` for running its service, thus we need to make a small change to the service's running `group` from `jellyfin` to `smbshare`.
In `/lib/systemd/system/jellyfin.service`, change the group from `jellyfin` to `smbshare`. Then refresh systemd with `systemctl daemon-reload` and restart service.
